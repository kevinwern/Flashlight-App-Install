# Apple Spotlight Extension: App Install Hints

Download apps directly from spotlight, using Flashlight extension

## How to use

* [Follow the instructions to install Flashlight](https://github.com/w0lfschild/Flashlight). THIS WILL REQUIRE DISABLING SIP.
* Clone this repo and name it app-install-hint.bundle.
* Copy it into $HOME/Libraries/FlashlightPlugins/
* Open spotlight, type 'appget <search phrase>', and select the app to download.

## There is more

But I am tired. It should be a limited amount of time before there is a more convenient way to do this (i.e. making it one of the defaults that come with Flashlight)
